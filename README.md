# Emotion Detection NLP with Flask

![Project Logo/Image (if any)](image-url-here.png)

## Overview

This is a Python-based web application that performs Emotion Detection using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It leverages a pre-trained machine learning model to analyze text input and determine the underlying emotion expressed in the text.

The web application is built using the Flask web framework, making it easy to deploy and interact with via a web browser. Users can input text, trigger the analysis, and receive the detected emotion as a result.
